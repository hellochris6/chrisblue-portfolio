Post Production Self-Service Archive Portal

Context
Role: Data Engineer / Solutions Developer
Objective: Built a self-service Streamlit portal for post-production S3 archiving, ensuring correct LucidLink staging.

Problem
Challenge: Inefficient manual S3 archiving processes lacked self-service and proper LucidLink staging, causing misfiles and user friction.
Data: Resulted in significant time wasted and potential for data integrity issues.
(Quick visual: Diagram of manual archiving bottlenecks.)

Action
