S3 Manifest Key Encoder (Python Script)

Role: Data Engineer / Solutions Developer
Objective: Automate S3 object key encoding for batch operations, resolving a critical technical support gap.

Problem
Challenge: S3 batch operations failed due to unaddressed URL encoding requirements for object keys, a high-level issue technical support couldn't resolve.
Data: Frequent operation failures and workflow delays caused by incorrect key encoding.
(Quick visual of the problem: diagram of failed operation, or problematic key example.)

Action
Process: Developed a Python 3.x script to read CSV input, URL-encode S3 object keys (urllib.parse.quote), and output a new encoded CSV.
Contribution: Independently designed and implemented a self-contained solution, requiring no external dependencies.
Seniority: Identified and resolved a critical operational bottleneck, delivering a targeted utility to unblock essential data workflows.
(Visuals are crucial here: screenshot of key code, or script's input/output flow diagram.)

Result
Solution: A reliable Python script for automated S3 object key URL encoding in manifest files.
Impact: Eliminated encoding errors, enabling consistent and reliable S3 batch operations.
Value: Streamlined data workflows, prevented data integrity issues, and removed a key technical barrier.
(Visual proof: "before and after" key example, or successful S3 batch operation confirmation.)

Final Product
A ready-to-use Python script (s3_key_encoder.py) generating compliant encoded CSV manifest files.
